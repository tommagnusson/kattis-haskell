# Kattis Solutions in Haskell

A continuation of Marist College's Haskell Language Study course, which required completion of [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/users/tom-magnusson) problems.

Most of the problems are solved, however some tricky ones are partially solved.

Approximate Kattis score June 2020: 160.
